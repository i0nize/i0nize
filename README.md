Web security enthusiast and math & physics student whose interest lies in VDPs and participating in CTFs. Most of my focus is spread across a diverse set of interests, of which include: fine-tunning open-source LLMs, developing physical and mathematical model representations in code and implementation of cryptographic algorithms for fun. Most projects created here (in GitHub) are purely for self-engaged learning and contributions to open-source material of which serves the same purpose.
